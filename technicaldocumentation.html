With HTML you can create your own Website.

                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages, it describes the structure of a Web page.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HTML consists of a series of elements, elements tell the browser how to display the content, and label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
                  </p>

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
                  </p>
                  <p>learn more about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a></p>
                  <p>
                    The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.

                    Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.

                    To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document <br>
                    Example:
                    <code>
                      <br>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
                    </code>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This <link> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:
                  </p>
                    <code>
                      h1 {<br>
                        color: red;
                      <br>}
                    </code>
                  <p>
                    Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.

                      You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.

                    There are many devices that can access the web, and they come in all shapes and sizes. Responsive web design is the practice of designing flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions.
                  </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. The viewport is a user's visible area of a web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site.
                        A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more expressions, which resolve to either true or false.
                        <br>Example:
                        <br>The following example changes the background-color to lightgreen if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels)
                        <code>
                          <br>@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {<br>
                            &nbsp;body {
                              &nbsp;<br>background-color: lightgreen;
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>}
                              &nbsp;<br>}
                        </code>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Make an Image Responsive, Making images responsive with CSS is actually very simple. You just need to add these properties to an image:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                          img {
                            max-width: 100%;
                            height: auto;
                          }
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        The max-width of 100% will make sure the image is never wider than the container it is in, and the height of auto will make the image keep its original aspect ratio.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution DisplaysPassed. The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is. Here is an example of an image that is only using half of the original height and width:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                          &lt;style&gt;
                            img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
                          &lt;/style&gt;
                          &lt;img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture"&gt;
                        </code>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Make Typography Responsive. Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.
                        <br>
                        <code>
                          &lt;h1 style="font-size:8vw;"&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
                          &lt;p style="font-size:2vw;"&gt;Resize the browser window to see how the font size scales.&lt;/p&gt;
                        </code>
